I have published the following crates on [crates.io](https://crates.io/)

[d3_geo_rs](https://crates.io/crates/d3_geo_rs)

[d3_delaunay_rs](https://crates.io/crates/d3_delaunay_rs)

[d3_geo_voronoi_rs](https://crates.io/crates/d3_geo_voronoi_rs)

They are ports of these npm packages [d3-geo](https://www.npmjs.com/package/d3-geo), [d3-delaunay](https://www.npmjs.com/package/d3-delaunay), [d3-geo-voronoi](https://www.npmjs.com/package/d3-geo-voronoi)

The greater performance afforded by RUST allows more complex data visualisations 

I am currently looking for work.
